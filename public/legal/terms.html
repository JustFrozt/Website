    <h1>Terms of Service for ZeroFormAI</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 30, 2025</p>
    <p>This document constitutes the Terms of Service ("Terms") for all services provided by Kasper Nils Frödin Persson, trading as "ZeroFormAI" ("Provider", "we", "us"). By placing an order with the Provider, you ("Client", "you") agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. The Service & Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>The Provider offers custom Python codebase development ("the Work"), including but not limited to APIs, data pipelines, and automation scripts. The specific deliverables, features, and functionality for each project will be explicitly defined in a formal written quote ("the Quote"). Services expressly outside the scope of the Work include front-end user interfaces, graphical mobile applications, and development in languages other than Python.</p>

    <h2>2. Quotes and Promotional Pricing</h2>
    <p>All prices displayed on the website (zeroformai.com), including any "Launch window pricing," are for informational and marketing purposes only and do not constitute a binding offer. The Provider reserves the right to modify, withdraw, or terminate any promotional pricing at any time without prior notice. The final, binding price, scope, and delivery timeline for any project are established exclusively in the formal Quote provided to and accepted by the Client.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard & Advanced Plans:</strong> 100% of the quoted price is payable upon delivery of the final Work.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Plans:</strong> A 30% non-refundable deposit is required before work begins. The remaining 70% is due upon delivery.</li>
      <li><strong>Invoicing:</strong> All invoices are issued via our payment partner, Frilans Finans AB, and are payable within 15 days of receipt.</li>
      <li><strong>VAT:</strong> All prices listed in the final Quote are inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) where applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Delivery, Acceptance, and Revisions</h2>
    <p>The Work will be delivered via a private Git repository or a secure download link.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Acceptance & Bug-Fix Window:</strong> The Client has <strong>5 business days</strong> from the date of delivery to review the Work and report any defects in writing. A "defect" is defined as a failure of the Work to perform in accordance with the specifications outlined in the Quote. The Provider will remedy any reported defects free of charge.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope Creep:</strong> The bug-fix window covers defects within the originally agreed-upon scope only. Any requests for new features, changes, or additions will be considered out of scope and will require a new, separate Quote.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>Upon receipt of full and final payment, the full intellectual property rights and ownership of the final codebase (the "Work") will transfer to the Client. The Provider retains the right to use general knowledge, techniques, and non-proprietary code elements for future projects.</p>

    <h2>6. Refunds, Cancellation, and Consumer Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Failure to Deliver:</strong> If the Provider fails to deliver the Work within the timeframe specified in the Quote, the Client is entitled to cancel the order and receive a 100% refund of any amount paid, including deposits.</li>
      <li><strong>Right of Withdrawal (EU/UK Consumers):</strong> By placing an order, you, as a consumer, expressly request that work begins immediately. You acknowledge that your statutory 14-day right of withdrawal is waived once the digital content has been fully delivered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Client Responsibilities and Warranties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cooperation:</strong> The Client agrees to provide timely feedback and any necessary materials (e.g., API keys, data samples) required for the project. If the Provider does not receive a response to a request for feedback within 30 calendar days, the Provider may consider the project abandoned and terminate the agreement without obligation for a refund.</li>
      <li><strong>Warranty of Materials:</strong> The Client represents and warrants that they own or have the necessary rights and permissions for all materials, data, and specifications provided to the Provider ("Client Materials"). The Client agrees to indemnify the Provider against any third-party claims of infringement arising from the use of Client Materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <div class="important-notice">
      <p><strong>"AS IS" PROVISION:</strong> ALL WORK AND DELIVERABLES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR OF BEING ERROR-FREE.</p>
      <p><strong>AI-GENERATED CODE WARNING:</strong> THE WORK IS LARGELY GENERATED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MAY CONTAIN INACCURACIES, BUGS, OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES. THE CLIENT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THOROUGHLY REVIEWING, TESTING, AND VALIDATING THE CODE BEFORE DEPLOYING IT IN ANY PRODUCTION OR LIVE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
      <p><strong>LIABILITY CAP:</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY THE CLIENT TO THE PROVIDER FOR THE SPECIFIC PROJECT IN QUESTION. THE PROVIDER IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>9. General Provisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Governing Law & Venue:</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of Sweden. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the District Court of Stockholm, except where mandatory consumer protection laws require a different venue.</li>
      <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> Before initiating legal action, the Client agrees to first contact the Provider at teamzeroform@gmail.com to seek an amicable resolution.</li>
      <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Neither party shall be liable for delays caused by events beyond their reasonable control, such as natural disasters, war, or serious illness.</li>
      <li><strong>No Agency:</strong> These Terms do not create an employment, partnership, or agency relationship. The Provider is an independent contractor.</li>
    </ul>
